# SQL-Data-Analysis-Part-5
SQL Project for Data Analysis using Oracle Database-Part 5

### Project Description

### What is Dataset Analysis? 

Dataset Analysis is defined as manipulating or processing unstructured or raw data to draw valuable insights and conclusions that will help derive critical decisions that add some business value. The dataset analysis process is followed by organizing the dataset, transforming the dataset, visualizing the dataset, and finally modeling the dataset to derive predictions for solving the business problems, making informed decisions, and effectively planning for the future.

 

### Oracle SQL Developer :

Oracle SQL Developer is a free IDE that makes it easy to develop and operate Oracle Database in both traditional and cloud environments. SQL Developer is a complete end-to-end development of PL/SQL jobs, worksheets for running queries and scripts,  DBA  for database administration, reporting interfaces, and comprehensive data modeling output.

 

### What is the Agenda of the project? 

This is the fifth project in the SQL project series; the fourth project involved the data analysis using WITH clause, the difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column_name), Categorization using the CASE statement, and various real-life case studies/problem statements. This project involves data analysis using different SQL functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, SUBSTR, INSTR, COALESCE and NVL. It also involves the use of some built-in functions like concat, upper, lower, initcap, rtrim, ltrim, length, lpad, rpad.
